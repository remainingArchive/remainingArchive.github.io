I need to ignore the first few bits. So I need a script to put it into a txt take the first few bits, ignore the first 20 or so bits, and transform the rest. OR, easier, I need it to shift only ALPHABET characters.

Block 0 - 7F should be ignored -> 46 is save.


Make it into a Vigenere, custom key and source: there are two variables, one is ME one is THE OTHER.

Ignore first 30 bits.

In the end, it was not that easy. It takes more than 30 bits, the lines are in the 50s. Sometimes, a header is only the beginning.
