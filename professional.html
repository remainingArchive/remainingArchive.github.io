            <h2> hello Professional,</h2>
            <p>Lets begin: You have to change the world, not the other way around.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>RED: the need to become good at what you do, the drive to continue until you are satisfied, the desire to be recognized.</li>
                <li>You know what it feels like to want to be the best. What is the amateur trying to perfect? She paints with her heart, she is looking for recognition. Document it, or it didn't happen. Tell everyone.</li>
                <li>Your color is chosen. But is this enough? Think about this.</li>
                <li>Ask the artists: Do they think they have to be a professional? <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">They all have something in common.</a></li>
            </ul>
