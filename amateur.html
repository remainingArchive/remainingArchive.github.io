            <h2> Hello Amateur,</h2>
            <p>Look at you. A lover at heart.</p>
            <p>
                Yes, you: you are an Amateur. I think that's beautiful, that we are all in this together.
                <br><br>
                I thought long and hard what it means to me, and I think what makes the Amateur a lover is their persistence.<br>
                Despite it all, you choose to love. You choose to continue. It's beautiful in its own way, because failing is inherent in your system - you love to fail so you can see how you fell in love in the first place.<br><br>
                Well done, make the world one of the Amateurs.
            </p>
