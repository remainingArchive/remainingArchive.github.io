<p>and amongst all that, the data has to be in the archive. There is nothing to use, if its not the data I inspect. Both documents the process and who I am in that moment, This machine is</p>

<p>What does it mean to transform and move all the bits, if we can't say anything is happening at all. For all we care, it's just numbers and letters. But in the end, when you see the pixels, the numbers taking shape, your visual cortex recognizing patterns, ideas and memories, something happens: You give it meaning, whether or not this is actually true is not of importance.</p>
<p>Maybe that means I'm thinking too much. That this roadblock tells me that I have to make the inevitable leap. That there is nothing left to think about.

It feels like waking up from something, and trying to piece together what has happened while I was asleep. 

You know, the weird thing is, I love it. In the end, I love the way it transforms everything, I love to see my work corrupted, transformed, distorted. I love to give this part of myself away, externalize it, and see it become something more than I thought it was.

All this time, I was looking desperately for something to make others understand, to communicate exactly what I saw. But this right here, it is its own thing. I don't need to bend and break it. All it needed was time and a moment of nothing. Maybe it's hard to understand because it is still with me.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels like I am floating in-between my Ideas and Works, and I actively fear pursuing them. Maybe that is why I avoid working on them - I am scared of never understanding. That nothing will be enough to tell.

It's as if I can't find a return to a destination I thought of.</p>
<p>I need to ignore the first few bits. So I need a script to put it into a txt take the first few bits, ignore the first 20 or so bits, and transform the rest. OR, easier, I need it to shift only ALPHABET characters.

Block 0 - 7F should be ignored -> 46 is save.


Make it into a Vigenere, custom key and source: there are two variables, one is ME one is THE OTHER.

Ignore first 30 bits.

In the end, it was not that easy. It takes more than 30 bits, the lines are in the 50s. Sometimes, a header is only the beginning.</p>
<p>Is it even a labyrinth, if its not made to be one?
What defines a labyrinth, really?

The monad - the beginning.
Before there was there was the monad. An eternity of some sort. A unity.

(it's all just an architecture.)</p>
<p>do you understand now, that everything is tied together, no matter how far you stray away from the path?

It's all for everything, never for nothing.</p>
<p>I need something to guide me back to everything that has happened. Through brute forcing only, nothing will continue. I see it all happening, but what is there to say, what is there to communicate?

A graveyard, the crypt of all I ever thought of, my head full of empty promises. It is to close it all, for some time. Sometimes, we should let things rest.

STAY FOCUSED
MY MIND IS EITHER DRIFTING OR DIGGING; THE BIGGER PICTURE IS ALWAYS OUT OF GRIP, I NEVER RETURN HOME.</p>
<p>This machine is slightly off. You start to realize, this is not for you. You can't open images, Zip files are irreparably damaged. The audio is inherrently wrong. The one thing you can do is destroy and encrypt, trying to find a pattern</p>
