I need something to guide me back to everything that has happened. Through brute forcing only, nothing will continue. I see it all happening, but what is there to say, what is there to communicate?

A graveyard, the crypt of all I ever thought of, my head full of empty promises. It is to close it all, for some time. Sometimes, we should let things rest.

STAY FOCUSED
MY MIND IS EITHER DRIFTING OR DIGGING; THE BIGGER PICTURE IS ALWAYS OUT OF GRIP, I NEVER RETURN HOME.
