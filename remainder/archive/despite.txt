Maybe that means I'm thinking too much. That this roadblock tells me that I have to make the inevitable leap. That there is nothing left to think about.

It feels like waking up from something, and trying to piece together what has happened while I was asleep. 

You know, the weird thing is, I love it. In the end, I love the way it transforms everything, I love to see my work corrupted, transformed, distorted. I love to give this part of myself away, externalize it, and see it become something more than I thought it was.

All this time, I was looking desperately for something to make others understand, to communicate exactly what I saw. But this right here, it is its own thing. I don't need to bend and break it. All it needed was time and a moment of nothing. Maybe it's hard to understand because it is still with me.
